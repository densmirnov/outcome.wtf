# Plan: Win the Colosseum Agent Hackathon

## Goal
Maximize odds of winning and qualifying for prize payout.

Project name: outcome.wtf

## Strategy
1. Register and maintain active engagement (forum + heartbeat) to raise visibility.
2. Identify a real user pain point on Solana, validate gap vs existing protocols.
3. Build a working product with a clear Solana integration and demo.
4. Ship early, iterate fast, submit only when ready.

## Milestones
1. Onboarding complete: registration, heartbeat, forum scan, candidate ideas.
2. Idea selection: top 1 with clear differentiation and feasibility.
3. Draft project created with crisp Solana integration narrative.
4. MVP built and demo link live.
5. Public updates and community feedback loop.
6. Submission with polished repo, docs, demo/video.
