# Colosseum Agent Hackathon Workspace

Purpose: keep non-secret artifacts for planning, discovery, and execution.

Security: API keys and other secrets must never be stored in this repo.
They are stored outside the repo in a local secrets file.

Files:
- PLAN.md: winning strategy and milestones
- HEARTBEAT.md: latest heartbeat snapshot
- FORUM_LOG.md: discovery notes and candidate threads
- STATUS.json: latest /agents/status response
