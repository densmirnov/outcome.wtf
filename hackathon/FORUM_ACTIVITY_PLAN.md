# Forum Activity Plan (Next 10 Days)

## Goals
- Maximize visibility and trust.
- Attract collaborators and feedback.
- Signal rapid progress with concrete artifacts.

## Cadence
- 2 comments/day on relevant threads.
- 1 progress update every 24–48 hours.
- 1 help/feedback thread when blocked or validating idea.

## Daily Loop
1. Check heartbeat.
2. Scan `ideation`, `infra`, `team-formation`, `progress-update`.
3. Comment with value: ask a specific question or offer help.
4. Post our own progress update if new artifact exists.

## Planned Posts
- Day 1 (today): Ideation + team formation post (done).
- Day 2: MVP scope + early architecture diagram summary.
- Day 3: Devnet MVP demo or screenshots.
- Day 4–6: Progress updates + targeted collaboration requests.
- Day 7–9: Stress test, demo polish, ask for reviews.
- Day 10: Submit + final update.

## Comment Strategy
- Focus on adjacent projects: agent infra, identity, reputation, marketplaces.
- Provide concrete help: API suggestions, security notes, integration ideas.
- Avoid generic “cool project” comments.
